Before hacking your way into more and more ambitious projects, take some time to understand Separation of Concerns: What's happening behind the screen is even more important than what the user sees!

__Separation of Concerns__ means that each piece of code has one simple and well defined task, that multiple pieces of code don't do the same thing, and that your files of code are well-organized according to their task.

Learning this principle early on in your programming career will help you to learn new techniques and frameworks, to test your code testing, to plan your projects, to collaborate, to debug, ... everything!

Understanding separation of concerns is possibly the most important thing a new programmer can learn. Far more important than learning new libraries, powerful devtools, hip frameworks, or even learning to solve difficult coding challenges.

## Pains & Gains

* Adding JavaScript into your sites will make them much more complicated.  Complexity is the eternal nemesis of software development!  Mastering _Separation of Concerns_ will earn you your white belt in conquering complexity.
* HTML & CSS are quite visual technologies, with a little help from the inspector it's possible to have a nearly-complete understanding of what's going on.  JavaScript is quite different!  While HTML & CSS control what you _see_ on the page, JavaScript controls what you can't see -> _data stored in memory_. Learning to visualize program memory and learning a _notional machine_ for how JavaScript steps through your programs are the ground-works for effective programming, problem solving, and debugging.
* It's nice to build sites that look nice, but at some point you'll want to build projects that _do_ something as well.  Using _DOM input_, _DOM output_, _event listeners_ and _handler functions_ you'll learn how to create user interfaces for your core JS logic functions.
* Manipulating arrays and objects can get quite complicated using only loops and conditionals.  You're much more likely to make mistakes, and you code will be harder to understand the next time you try to read it.  Learn how to use native JS _Array & Object methods_ for easier coding and debugging.

## What you can Build

Beautiful, accessible, responsive web pages that accept user input, process it with your JS functions, and display the result for the user.

## Tech Stack

What's new in this module?

* The DOM
  * Event Listeners and Handlers
  * Using forms to handle user input

## New Frontiers

It won't take long before users are bored of websites that never evolve over time, always doing the same thing no matter what.  Your next-level web pages will have saved data that users interact with over time, and have dynamic user interfaces that update to reflect changes in ...
