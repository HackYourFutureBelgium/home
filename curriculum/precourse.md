## What to expect at HYF?

We are a community of people who want to make the web a better place.

You can expect a growing network, friendships, Sunday fun, a lot of learnings, hard times getting stuck in code, and satisfaction when you reach your goals.

Please read the _'Learning chapter'_ in our [**Study Guidebook**](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning).
It will help you become a great HackYourFuture Student.
We also expect you to know our:

- [Core Values](../CORE-VALUES.md)
- [Code of Conduct](../CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

so we can make the web a better place together! :muscle:

### What tools do we use?

#### Slack - how we communicate

Slack is used to communicate between coaches and students during the week. Each class has their own channel in Slack where module specific questions can be asked. We require our students to be active on Slack and ask questions when they get stuck. Students are off course also stimulated to help each other out.

#### GitHub - how we learn coding

Our [Github repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/) contains all the specifications and learning goals for the different modules. It's advised to get yourself familiar with Github.

### How do we teach?

Read through these pages to know what's coming your way:

- [the Curriculum Home Page](./README.md)
- [how Sunday Classes work](../students/sunday-classes.md)t
- [our homework submission process](../students/homework-submission.md)

## Precourse Assignments

_hint_: Focus on Git and GitHub!

### Priorities

Not all assignments are created equal. These 3 emoji's will help you decide how to budget your time.

- :egg: `:egg:` - these assignments are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
- :hatching_chick: `:hatching_chick:` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them (yet) but getting the main idea will be helpful in coming weeks
- :hatched_chick: `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the :egg:'s and :hatching_chick:'s? push yourself with these challenges!

### Create Accounts

#### GitHub Account

:warning: Create a username that resembles your real name!! :warning:

:egg: [Create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/join)

#### Slack Account

Install the Slack Apps on your:

- Mobile: [App store](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack&hl=nl)
- Desktop: [OSX](https://slack.com/downloads/osx) or [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows)

Be active on Slack! This is how you'll start meeting and helping each other before the class starts. Once you are in, join the channel #classN and write "hej ðŸ‘‹". (If your classnumber is 9 the Slack channel will be called #class9).

We also ask you **not to use fake names** - as you will use this channel for advice and feedback it will be helpful if your mentors know who is who. Adding **a photo** to your profile is _required_ :)

- Sign on to Slack and introduce yourself.
- Share your GitHub username in your introduction
- Let us know if you haven't received an invitation yet.

### Install Softwares

:egg: Make sure you have all of these softwares installed on your computer:

- [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) & [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): All great browsers with ES6, HTML5 & CSS3 support plus pre-installed, top-knotch developer tools. Be sure to test your projects on all 3!
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): Like Microsoft Word, but for code ... and _sooooo_ much better.
  After installing VSC, be sure to install these plug-ins:
  - [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
  - [Markdown Preview GitHub Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles)
  - [MarkdownLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
  - [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode#overview)
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
  - [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- Node.js: [if you don't have windows](https://nodejs.org/en/), [if you have windows](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
- (If you have windows) [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/): This will allow you to use the same terminal commands & tools as Linux or Mac computers.
- [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download): A program to make working with Git more visual.

If you have a Windows machine, it's recommended that you set up your computer for [dual-booting Linux](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot). Windows will work fine at the beginning of the course, but later on will make things more difficult for you. Get in touch with one of your coaches if you'd like to get this set up already.

### Markdown

The biggest part of programming isn't coding, it's communicating. Every software project comes with documentation that helps you understand how it works, and you will learn how to write these documents yourself! Markdown is the default language for writing everything in a software project (except the code itself).

Fortunately, markdown is also pretty simple. Take a look through these links before the first day of class so you're ready to hit the ground running.

- :egg: Complete this [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- :hatching_chick: Practice [previewing markdown files with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown)

### Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are how you will do _everything_ while at HackYourFuture. Homework submission, Sunday classes, projects, collaboration, coach feedback, _everything_! The more time you spend studying Git and GitHub before class starts, the easier it will be to focus on the fun stuff.
