Enter: JavaScript!  Up till now, your web pages didn't really _do_ anything (except be beautiful :). In this module you will focus on two layers of understanding JavaScript:

1. **Source Code**: Learn the syntax (grammar) and key words (vocabulary) of the JavaScript language.
1. **Machine Instructions**: Understand how the JavaScript interprets your source code to create a running program.

## Pains & Gains

* So far your websites haven't been very interactive.  You will learn how to use the `onclick` attribute to connect elements in your UI to JavaScript for basic user interactions
* Having a website that does the exact same thing every time you click a button isn't very interesting.  Learn to structure user interactions with _handler functions_ and read in user input using `prompt` & `confirm`

## What you can Build

You will learn how to plan, organize, develop, and debug websites that implement simple user interactions with `prompt`, `confirm` and `alert`.
