# Web Apps

You've made it to fullstack!  __Web Apps__ are applications split up across the internet with different parts running on different machines in different parts of the world.  So far your projects have all run directly in the user's browser.  The code was served from a server (GitHub Pages), and they used data or logic from elsewhere on the web (API's), but all of the code you wrote ran in one place - the client's browser. All of that is about to change.

In this module you will learn how to develop applications that follow the _client/server_ arrangement with a _backend_ run on a server that stores & serves data, and a _frontend_ run in the browser that displays and accesses the data in your server.  To make this happen you will learn how to read & write from your computer's file system, send & receive HTTP requests, deploy your own APIs, and serve your own HTML/CSS/JavaScript files without the help of GitHub Pages.

## Pains & Gains

* The "Big Picture" will come together.  After months of focusing in on just one half of web apps (the client) you will finally see everything come together.
* Persistent user experiences: No more will a user's data be lost each time they refresh the page.  Saving data in your back end's file system will enable users to store data for later and even interact with each other over time!
* Gain confidence with your computer.  Learning to interact directly with your computer's file system from your applications will give you a confidence and comfort that is reassuring.

## What you can Build

By the end of this module you will be able to build, test and deploy basic fullstack web apps using Node & Express in the backend, and HTML+CSS+JS in the frontend.

Because these apps allow users to interact with data stored on your server's file system instead of just temporary data stored in their browsers, you can now provide a _persistent_ experience.  This means that each time a user closes their browser and opens it again they will be able to pick off right where they left off.

## New Frontiers

Saving all of your data in .json and text files becomes limiting very quickly.  Planning how you'll organize your data is not so simple, it's challenging to remember where everything is, searching for specific data is time consuming, and small changes here or there can break everything!  You're in luck.  All of these problems can be avoided by learning the subtle art of ...
