# Career Skills

Spaced through the course we organise several career skills workshops on **Sunday mornings** before class. These can cover everything from how to present yourself during a job interview, working remotely together, how to use LinkedIn as a tool, social integration programs who introduce themselves, to ... you name it.

Get in touch with us if you have an idea for these sessions!
