Stepping through and understanding your code's execution is interesting, but nearly as fun as solving a good puzzle.  You will learn to confidently solve coding challenges, and to use tests for confidence and communication.

## Pains & Gains

* Are you tired of Strings, Numbers, and Booleans?  Then you'll have a good time with Arrays and Objects :)
* `console.assert` works very well for inline tests, but sometimes you need more substantial testing. Learn how to use testing frameworks like Mocha and Jasmine for full testing suites.
* `prompt` and `alert` work well enough, but they have their limits.  Learn to read and write from DOM elements for a better user experience.

## What you can Build

Simple websites that showcase your coding challenges: live test reports, live sand-boxes, and documentation.
