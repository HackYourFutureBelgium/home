Markdown is great but it is limited. Markdown is meant for writing clean documentation not creating beautiful web pages!  Enter: HTML & CSS.

With just these web technologies you can already make some truly beautiful and interested web pages.  Along with this increased greatness you'll also find your projects becoming larger and more complicated.  This makes it trickier to keep your work organized, fix your mistakes, and know how far you are through your project.

This is where _Incremental Development_ comes in.  Aside from HTML & CSS, the main skill you will encounter in this module is how to break a large project into small steps that build on top of each other.  You'll learn how, with a little extra discipline (and some help from Git :),  moving one little step at a time can magically make large projects understandable, and make fixing your mistakes much easier.

## Pains & Gains

* Never get lost in your own project!  Learn how to organize your development process around user stories and build each one on a separate branch.
* A great idea stays just a great idea if you can't share it! Learn to create accessible web pages to clearly convey your ideas to any audience.
* But wait!  People browsing the web aren't the only ones using your project.  Other developers need to understand your project, your process, and your code in order to help you learn or to collaborate.
* Have you ever opened a web site on your phone and had to spend _all_ of your time scrolling and resizing?  Save your users the trouble by implementing responsive design in your web pages.
* HTML & CSS are relatively simple to learn, but impossible to master without understanding what happens behind the scenes.  Learning about the 3 general stages of a basic web page (source code -> DOM -> rendered site), and mastering the inspector will enable you to debug your web pages with confidence.

## What you can Build

In this module you will learn to build static, responsive web pages using HTML5 & CSS3.  But just building pretty pages doesn't make you a developer!

More important than the finished project is the process you go through to create it. Learn the discipline it takes to plan ahead, break your project into small steps, and finish one step completely before moving on to the next.

Along with a live web page you will learn to build a complete GitHub repository to host the source code.  This includes feature branches, a full README, and a link to your project hosted with GH-Pages.

## New Frontiers

Beautiful web pages can be nice to look at, but after a while you'll want more from your projects than pretty face.

Transforming your web sites from static & visual pages into dynamic & interactive ones will require a little help from JavaScript.  Before you dive right into hacking your pages alive, take some time to learn about ...
