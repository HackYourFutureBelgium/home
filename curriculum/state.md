# State

In the previous module you learned to decompose & plan projects, organize your code, and use HTML/CSS/JS to implement simple websites that process user input.  All well and good but there was something missing.  Your projects never "remembered" anything!

Enter: __State__.  This is a fancy programming term to talk about the _data_ stored by your web pages.  Nearly every app you use has state -> message histories, images, profile details, weather reports, ... you name it!  Data is the core of any application. Just like you learned to write tests to describe your functions and show that they do what they should, you will learn how to use schemas and validation to prove that your program data in fact what you say it is.

Your new projects will be more interesting, but they will also be a lot more complicated.  The logic will be more challenging, and the data saved in your page will change over time leading to bugs you could never have imagined!  To help you deal with the added complexity this module will dive deeply into debugging techniques, problem solving strategies, and your browser's developer tools.

## Pains & Gains

* Projects from the last module weren't very interesting to use, they did the same thing every time you triggered an event.  Adding state to your web pages will make much more interesting user experiences that can change and evolve over time based on decisions a user makes. Almost like a ... game?
* Create web sites that change and react to user interactions with _DOM manipulation_.  Learn how you can use JavaScript to modify what a user sees, updating your web page's UI to reflect changes in program _state_.
* Boost your confidence by learning how to pause programs with `debugger`, step through execution and inspect program state with the browser's built-in devtools.  This is _the foundation_ of effective debugging and program understanding.
* And no programming course is complete without a few hard coding challenges :)  Get lots of practice with proven strategies for identifying, breaking down, and solving coding challenges.

## What you can Build

Interactive web pages that save user data in an object or array, update the saved data based on user actions, and change the user interface based on what is stored in memory.

## Tech Stack

What's new in this module?

* JavaScript
  * Reference vs. Value
* The DOM
  * DOM Manipulation
  * DOM Components

## New Frontiers

By the end of the module your project's will have more code, and do many more things than they did at the beginning.  You'll likely find it challenging to keep everything organized in your mind.  And making changes to one user story might mean changing code in 3, or even 4 files!
