# Asynchronous Programming

> Find the Module repository [right here]() (coming soon)

"The Internet", "The Web", "Web Apps".  All of these terms describe something that is interconnected.  If you zoom out a bit, the entire internet is basically billions of computers all sharing information and software!  But so far your projects have been all alone on your computer :(

Understand the role of __Public APIs__ in modern computing and application development.  You'll never build a boring app again once the entire internet is at your fingertips :)

## Pains & Gains

* Your projects up to now have been super cool, but imagine if they were *SUPER* cool. Everything is possible once you learn to integrate Public APIs into your projects!  Learn to use data from all over the internet, to access top-notch algorithms, and to integrate other website's content & services into your projects using Public APIs.
* Including 10 scripts in your HTML file and reusing your code from the global scope is a messy way to develop. It is harder to keep track of everything in your mind, and makes it easy to accidentally break your site with small changes. Learn to split your code into small single-modules for testing, maintenance and reuse with `import`/`export`.

## What you can Build

Learn to build web pages that connect users to Public APIs for anything from checking the weather, to catching a train, and even Machine Learning.  To integrate Public APIs into your projects, you will learn how the JS Event Loop handles asynchronous execution.

## Tech Stack

What's new in this module?

* JavaScript
  * arrow functions
  * closure
  * The Event Loop: `setTimeout` & `setInterval`
  * Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await
* In the Browser
  * `fetch`
* In Node.js
  * `require`
  * `readFile` vs. `readFileSync`

## New Frontiers

Wouldn't it be nice if you could save user data between page loads? Or if you could read and write data directly to your computer? You sure can! But then you're no long just building frontend apps, you're building ...
