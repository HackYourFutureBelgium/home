# Mentor/Mentee Journey

The ideal HackYourFuture Dream Mentorship Journey looks like this:

1. Intake session
2. \[Update CV & LinkedIn profile\]
3. \[Write Motivation Letter\]
4. \[Pitch Training\]
5. \[Mock Interview\]
6. \[Closing of the Journey\]

### 1. Intake session

* Purpose and duration of the intake session
* Clarification of what the HYF mentorship journey is about
* Agreement of number of sessions scheduled and dates
* Methods of communication
* Ground rules for missed or late sessions
* What the mentee can expect from their mentor
* What the mentor wants from their mentee
* Rules about Honesty, Openness & Confidentiality \(HOC-rule\)
* Assessment of where mentee is now
* What the mentee wants to achieve – long, medium, short term
* Priorities to work on
* Confirmation of next session – date/time

### 2. Update CV and LinkedIn profile

Some criteria former mentors used:

* The profile has to be complete: not such a series of work experience, but more about what was **the contribution of the candidate**.
* It should have a link to the company they worked for \(website,  etc.\), size of the company and market or sector. This way it looks way more professional \(it is very '_Linkedin-able_'\)
* There should be a summary explaining who the person is and what she/he aspires to be.

### 3. Write Motivational letter

**The structure of a Motivation letter:**  
  
**Introduction:** A short, engaging pitch about yourself and why you are applying. Here, you can include:

* Personal information. Who are you and what do you do?
* What are you applying for? Where?
* An intro to the bulk of your essay. Mention the general reason on why you’re applying, and then deep-dive in the bulk of your motivational letter.

**Body of the Motivational Letter:** this is the main bulk of your motivational letter. This is where you really sell yourself, mentioning stories behind your achievements, skills, and passion for the job/internship.

Try to be as factual as possible. When possible, you can also use metrics to back up your qualifications.

**Conclusion:** Finally, you can wrap up the motivational letter, including:

* a brief summary of your main points
* your overarching goal
* thankful words for the reader

**How to assess the motivational letter?**

### 4. Mock Interview

**What should you assess?**

* Assess **attitude first**. Skills are secondary and can be learned on the fly.
* Always ask about **what gives energy** to the candidate \(is it interactions, challenges, people,...?\) -&gt; This helps understand how the role/job they interview for will match their personality and energy level. Someone who loves interacting with people might suffer from a full remote job, for example.
* Ask about **what drains the energy** of the candidate .
* Check skills and understanding of **Scrum**. It's a must have these days.
* Check what they do about **conflict in the workplace**, how they try to solve it.

 **Some classical interview questions, to prepare for a mock interview:**

1. Tell me something about yourself
2. Why would you be a good fit for company X?
3. Why do you think you would be a good developer?
4. What are your goals for the next 5 years?
5. Are you a team player or do you prefer to work by yourself. Why?
6. What are your biggest accomplishments professionally/otherwise?
7. How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
8. What is your greatest weakness?
9. How does a perfect day on the job look like for you?
10. Do you have any questions?

### 5. Closure of the Journey

_'Mentoring never stops'_, said one of our mentors lately.  
  
However, we believe it is important to close the mentorship journey.  
It is good to take some time to:

* ask feedback from your mentee
* do a self-evaluation on the journey
* connect with the HYF-team to give an update about the status of your mentee
* consider if you'd like to do another mentorship journey in the future

That said, of course we would appreciate immensely if you keep in touch with your mentee and the HackYourFuture community in general.

Because, it is thanks to volunteers like you that our graduates kick-start their career in Belgium.
