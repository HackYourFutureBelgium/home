# Mentoring Roles

## Journey Mentor

As a journey mentor, you do our Dream Mentorship Yourney - which takes at least 6 weeks - with one \(or more\) of our students.  
  
For every graduating class, there is a period for mentoring, which we will communicate with you once you've applied.

Do you want to go on this journey with one or several of our graduates and kick-start their career in Belgian IT? Are you available for **6 weeks in a row \(at least 2h/week\)**? Become Journey Mentor!

## One-to-one Mentor \(longer term\)

A one-to-one mentor engages for a longer term relationship with a mentee. This means you follow-up on this HYF graduate on a regular basis, **until he/she has found a job**.

You can evolve from Journey Mentor \(see above\) to one-to-one, if you don't want to let go your mentee after 6 weeks. ;\)

Do you want to make **a longer-term commitment** at our HYF community? Become One-to-one mentor!

## Mock Interviewer

Are you an expert in assessing job interviews? As a Mock Interviewer you focus on this part of our HYF mentorship journey.  
  
Once every 4 months, we connect you with the amount of students you want to do a mock interview with.  
  
You can schedule the mock interviews whenever fits best for you and the graduates/students.  
  
Can't you wait to start this important step in our HYF-students learning journey? Do you like to commit some time **on a regular basis, limited to a short period \(2/3 weeks\)**? Become Mock Interviewer!

## Career Training Mentor

Do you have experience in job training?

Once every 4 months we're looking for volunteers who can do a Sunday session on career training, before our coding class starts at BeCentral.

Do you want to be involved for **one day/4months**? Then this is the perfect role for you!
