# Become a mentor

## Which attitudes and skills do we expect from you?

* Openness to cultural differences
* Willingness to learn
* Intermediate level of English \(minimum\). If you speak Dutch and/or French too, that's a plus.
* Past experience mentoring is a plus, but is not required! We are open for anyone who wants to help and we would love to include you in our community.

## What's in it for you?

* You will contribute to improving the lives of others through tech education
* You will become better expert of your own craft by teaching your knowledge
* You will be exposed to different cultures and different ways of thinking & working
* You will become a part of Migracode’s professional network, including tech Meetups, companies, NGO’s and other professional developers

## Expectations

* Starting a mentorship journey implies that you'll also finish it. We don't finish journeys somewhere in between.
* At least one offline meeting* is encouraged. Mentoring is about both online and offline meetings.
* Feedback to both HYF-staff and your mentee is key. 


*If you can't do offline meetings because of physical mobility reasons, we respect that. If you let us know, we can ask another mentor to take over for your offline meeting.
