# Review Calls

... you can organize them with students based on your schedule and theirs ...
can cover whatever topics are needed ...

There are two parts to a review call:

## Check-Ins

Each Wednesday, students are expected to post an update on their individual
progress as a comment in their `individual` issue. They should include their
_Progress_, _Blocked_, _Next Steps_, and _Tip\(s\)_.

When you have time over Wednesday \(and Thursday, sometimes students post their
updates late Wednesday or early Thursday\) take a look through all the Wednesday
Check-in comments for your class. You can find them by filtering the class
issues for the labels `check-in` & `week-x`, and the milestone `module-name`.

After you've read a student's check-in:

- label it `checked-x` \(depending on which week it is\)
- leave a friendly comment in their issue
- and follow up with them in private on Slack if they could use the extra help.

As you're going through the class check-ins, take note of common questions for
the evening's review call and/or for Sunday class.

## Evening Review Call

Each Wednesday evening there is a review call. There's no set schedule or
objective for this call. It's an informal moment to get together and discuss the
week's material.

### Scheduling the Call

The call can take place any time of day depending on your and the students'
availability. You can coordinate a time on Slack using a simple poll-message
pinned to the class channel. Slack has some clock emojis :clock: that can be
helpful. As usual, feel free to change the template to match your schedule and
your class:

It's Wednesday again!

Let us know what you'd like to review this evening in a thread under this poll.
