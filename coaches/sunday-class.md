# Sunday Class

It's helpful to think about each Sunday Class as **a workshop instead of a lecture hall**.

You are expected to **study the assigned prep work _before_ arriving*- - this will cover the theory you need to dive into the exercises on Sunday. Most of your time each Sunday will be spent working in small groups on a set of exercises and a small project. Coaches are there in the first place to support your groups, not to teach the material.

_You will not cover the whole week's material on Sunday._ In Sunday Classes you will cover just enough new material to finish a small project in class.  This new material and mini-project will help you to get started with the week's assignments but (repeat) _are not everything you need to learn_.  **HYF is a majority self-study course.*- It's not your coaches' responsibility to make sure you learn everything!

So come prepared each Sunday to spend some time together and practice collaborating in small groups.  After all, these are the hardest things to study alone over the week :)

## Checklists

### The Week Before Class

- [ ] Have a call with your fellow coaches and an HYF team member
- [ ] Review the class schedule (this document!).
- [ ] Read through the class' objectives and exercises.
- [ ] Assign yourselves between the small groups
- [ ] Decide who will lead the review session.
- [ ] Decide who will introduce the exercises in the first half.
- [ ] Decide who will introduce the project in the second half.
- [ ] Decide who will introduce the next week's homework.

### Sunday

- [ ] Look through all the `sunday-review` issues in the class repo to prep for the review session
- [ ] Share the week's _Roll Call_ issue ~15 minutes before class
- [ ] Record your full-class sessions (review/isolate, integrate, homework launch)
- [ ] Save enough time for small group study!
- [ ] Lead a Standup meeting when your group meets for the Isolate exercises
- [ ] Post & pin a [Slack Poll](#slack-poll) after each group study session

### After Class

- [ ] Uploaded and link to your class recordings in the class repo.
- [ ] Send an end-of-day message on the class channel.
- [ ] Send follow-up messages to any students who were struggling, or had questions outside the scope of class.

## Slack Poll

Right after the Isolate exercises and the Integrate project (so two times each Sunday), poll the class on their slack channel to get a feel for how everyone is doing. Polls are as simple as a message pinned to the class channel where students can react to share their response.  Below is a basic template you can copy-paste into Slack.  Feel free to change it however you like, this is just here for inspiration:

```md
@channel

friendly and motivating words

:hourglass_flowing_sand: = A little slower please
:thumbsup_all:  = It’s all clear for me until now
:sleeping:  = Class may go faster
:fire: = This is awesome! if only class were longer ...
```

# Class Schedule:

## Roll Call - Before Class (11:45-12:00)

Create and share a _Roll Call_ issue on the class' slack channel.  There is a template issue in the class repository, but do feel free to modify it however you like.

So everyone can find the issue later please:

- label it with `roll-call` and `week-X`
- assign it to the module's milestone

## All Together - Review & Today's Project

### Review

Review any common mistakes you saw in the week's homework, common blocks from the [Wednesday Check-Ins](../students/wednesday-check-in), and any questions from the [Sunday Review Issues](../students/asking-for-help).

Try to keep this part of class succinct so there is enough time for the new material in small groups.  A good way to do this is to not take any new questions during the review session, only answering questions shared before class.  There

### Today's Objectives

Your coaches will give a short introduction to this Sunday's exercises and project. They will help you understand _why_ the new material is important and _how_ you will use it in the class project. Because you are expected to have studied the prep work and theory before Sunday, the coaches will spend this time stepping through some practical examples instead of explaining the basics.

## Small Groups - Isolate

Break into your small groups and get started on this Sundays' exercises!

### Stand Up

Do a quick stand-up meeting, this is your chance to share what went well and what was difficult last week.  But keep it short! You shouldn't take longer than ~30 seconds per person. This is a chance to practice being clear and precise about what you are learning.



### The Exercises

Each module repository has a directory called `/isolate`.  In there you will find all of the exercises and example snippets for the module.  The **Sunday Lesson Plan & README*- will list the exercises/examples to focus on that Sunday.

Some tips for studying code:

- Don't rush, understand!  Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study for the rest of the week.
  - It's better to fail slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass quickly and not understand why.
- Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
- Don't skip the examples!  Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very efficient way to learn programming.
- Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips.

## All Together: Check-In (13:50-14:00)

A check-in from each group, keep it short and to the point!

- A report on your group's stand-up
- What went well with the exercises?
- What was challenging in the exercises?

## Break (14:00-14:30)

Peace and crackers!

## All Together - Project Prep

Your coaches will review the exercises that caused you all the most trouble and introduce the Sunday project. this might include:

- Explaining how what you learned in the exercises fits with what you've learned before
- Explaining when they've used these skills in their real lives
- A demo of how your finished project should behave
- Stepping through the project starter code
- Sharing some debugging tips that will come in handy

## Small Groups - Integrate

Break into your small groups and begin working on the day's project (after studying the examples ;))!
Each module repository has a directory called `/integrate`.  In there you will find a collection of finished projects to study.  **The Sunday Lesson Plan & README*- will list the example projects that are most helpful for this Sunday.

The project itself will be hosted as a separate repository so you can practice pushing, pulling, branching and collaboration.  You will find a link to the starter repo in the Lesson Plan and weekly README.

Some tips for working on the projects:

- Pair programming!
- Take turns explaining how the example projects work:
  - Which files and folders are there? What role does each one play in the program?
  - What language features are used in the program?
  - How is today's new material integrated into the project?
- Practice workflows and project planning. There's plenty of time to write code over the week, spend your time together practicing collaboration:
  - Write or study the Development Strategy together before starting to code
  - Try forking your group's repository and sending a pull request with one of the user stories completed
  - Open a project board and practice using issues to manage your project

## All Together - Check-In & Homework Launch (15:45-16:00)

### Check-In: Project

A ~1 minute check-in from each group on what you've learned and struggled with in the class project.

### Homework Launch

Your coaches will give a quick introduction to the week's assignments.

Now's your last chance to ask any questions you have in person!
