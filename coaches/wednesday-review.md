# Wednesday Review

There are two parts to Wednesday Review:

## Check-In Issues

When you have time over Wednesday (and Thursday, sometimes students post their issues late) take a look through all the `wednesday-check-in` issues for your class. You can find them by filtering the class issues for the labels `week-X` & `wednesday-check-in`, and the milestone `module-name`.

After you've read a student's check-in:
* label it `checked`
* leave a friendly comment in their issue
* and follow up with them in private on Slack if they could use the extra help.

As you're going through the class check-ins, take note of common questions for the evening's review call and/or for Sunday class.

## Evening Review Call

Each Wednesday evening there is a review call. There's no set schedule or objective for this call. It's an informal moment to get together and discuss the week's material.

### Scheduling the Call

The call generally takes place between 4pm and 6pm depending on your and the students' availability. You can coordinate a time on Slack using a simple poll-message pinned to the class channel. Slack has some clock emojis :clock: that can be helpful. As usual, feel free to change the template to match your schedule and your class:

```md
@channel
It's Wednesday again!

Let us know what you'd like to review this evening in a thread under this poll.

What time works best this week?
