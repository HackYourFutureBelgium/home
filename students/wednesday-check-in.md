# Wednesday Check-In

> Psst. Please don't put these on the homework project board unless you are blocked! Then put it in the 'BLOCKED' column so we know to help you

Each wednesday you are be expected to create a _new_ issue updating your classmates and coaches on your progress since Sunday. The first step is to set up your issue:

- **Name**: Name your issue something helpful
- **Assign**: Assign the issue to yourself.
- **Label**: Label your issue with `week-n` _and_ `wednesday-check-in`.
  - If your repo has more than one class, please label with your classs number: `class-n`
- **Milestone**: Set the current module as a milestone.

The next step is to write these four section in your issue's description:

1. **Progress**: What have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
2. **Blocked**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you strugging to complete?
3. **Next Steps**: What are your goals and your study plans for the rest of the week?
4. **Tip(s) of the week**: Share some tips, tricks or links that made a big difference for you.

And the last step is to read each others' issues. Maybe you've already figured out one of your classmate's problems, or maybe they can help you with yours. We're all in this together!

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it `checked`.

- If you're not blocked on anything, please close the issue after it has been checked.  And be ready for it!  We can now assign to help a classmate with their blocked check-in :)
- If you are blocked on something then we will assign someone to help you out, and you can close the issue when you are un-blocked.
