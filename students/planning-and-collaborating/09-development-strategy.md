# 9. Development Strategy

You will now begin translating your _**must-have** User Stories_ and your design into specific coding tasks. You can plan the rest of your user stories during Development after the **must-have**s are built.

As you build your project you will find mistakes in your strategy. Don't panic; adapt. This is the _agile_ way! It's not possible to plan everything perfectly.

When you need to adapt your plans during development you can update your project board and your Development Strategy. When you write your retrospective it's useful to compare your initial development strategy to your final strategy and project board. This will help you learn to plan better in the future by comparing what you _actually_ did to what you _predicted_ you'd do.

## Template File

Here's some markdown you can copy-paste into `/planning/development-strategy.md`:

```text
# Project Name

<!-- describe your project -->

---

## Setup

<!-- what code do you need just to open the project? this might include:
  - boilerplate code (https://brandlitic.com/what-is-boilerplate-code/)
  - loading program data
  - rendering the initial user interface
-->

---

<!-- copy this section once for each must-have user story -->

## user story

<!-- each issue created from this section will have the `for: user story` label -->

> "as a ... i can ... so that ..."

<!-- write any extra notes or description -->

<!-- describe the tasks to build this user story
  these will have the `type: logic` label, for example
  not all projects will have all types of tasks
  and these are not the only possible types, just some suggestions
-->

### Logic: user story

- a _logic_ task -> this will become one issue
  - [ ] some checkboxes for this task
  - [ ] these will be copy-pasted into the issue

### Interface: user story

- an _interface_ task -> this will become one issue
  - [ ] some checkboxes for this task
  - [ ] these will be copy-pasted into the issue

### Interaction: user story

- an _interaction_ task -> this will become one issue
  - [ ] some checkboxes for this task
  - [ ] these will be copy-pasted into the issue

### Documentation: user story

- a _documentation_ task -> this will become one issue
  - [ ] some checkboxes for this task
  - [ ] these will be copy-pasted into the issue
```
