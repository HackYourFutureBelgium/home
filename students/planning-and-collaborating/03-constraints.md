# Constraints

After dreaming big, the most helpful thing you can can do to define your project is to be clear about _what it isn't_. Thinking big is great for brainstorming but can get in the way of finishing your projects on time.

An important step to _scoping_ your project is to discuss your group's **constraints** before you even begin thinking of user stories. Defining your constraints will help to define a realistic project and commit to it. Constraints can also help you to build a more creative project!

It may not sound intuitive, but the fewer restrictions you have on your work the less likely you are to find a creative solution! The crucial skills you need to learn is how to place _constructive_ constraints on your project and on your team.

## Template File

Here's some markdown you can copy-paste into your `/planning/constraints.md` file:

```markdown
# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over. they may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
```
