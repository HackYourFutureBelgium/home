# Retrospective

> “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

All done :\)

Your team has either finished the project ahead of time, or the deadline has arrived and you're still not finished. No problem either way!

A retrospective is meant for looking back at how the project went and learning what to do differently next time. An incomplete project with a great retrospective is still a success.

## Behaviors, not People!

Focus on what your group can _do_ that will make the next sprint better. A huge list of things to stop doing doesn't help you move forward.

Retrospectives are all about behaviors that can be changed, not people that need fixing. Keep your retrospectives _positive_ and _general_. **_You should NEVER mention people by name!!!_**

## Strategy vs. Board

Take some time as a group to compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board.

- What parts of your plan went as expected?
- What parts of your plan did not work out?
- Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
- Or remove extra steps?

## The Four Points

Your group will summarize your work by providing answers to these three questions. You can have more than one answer! You can answer with bullet points, paragraphs, links, images ... whatever is most clear.

- **Stop Doing**: what mistakes did you make? did you miss a step? could your communication have been better? be specific!
- **Continue Doing**: what went well that you should continue doing in the next project? be specific!
- **Start Doing**: any good ideas you'd like to try out in the next project? be specific!
- **Lessons Learned**: what cool things or general lessons has your team learned? This can be about anything, not just code!
