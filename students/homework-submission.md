## Submission Deadline

> Due Friday afternoon

Your homework submissions are due by Friday to give your coaches time to review them before Sunday. You are expected to complete as many of the exercises as possible and to have made good progress on the project. It's ok if you don't finish, it's more important that you master what you can and let us know what you need help with. They'll always be there for you to review later :)

Submit your homework even if you haven't finished the project! If you weren't able to finish the project, pleas leave some notes in your homework issue explaining what you struggled, how far you made it, and what you were able to finish. This will help your coaches know how they can help you individually and collectively when you discuss the project together in class.

What counts as a homework submission?

1. You have created a new issue with a clear and helpful title.
1. The issue has links to your completed weekly project, including a separate link to each branch. (the project must be completed!)
1. You have linked to each of the assigned exercise repositories, even if they are not completed.
1. All of the links must work! One dead link will count as a whole missing assignment.
1. You have labeled your issue `ready-for-review`
1. Your card needs to be in the "READY FOR REVIEW", "NEEDS REVISION" column.

If your project is not finished or has some problems, your coach will move your card to "NEEDS REVISION" after checking your work on Friday. This still counts as an on-time homework submission.

If the project is finished and the coach has no further comments, they will close your issue and move it to the "DONE" column.

## Homework Issues

For each week you will create a new _homework issue_. You, your coach and your classmates will use will use it to track your progress, help you when you're stuck, and give feedback when you've finished. Your class repository has a template issue you can use to help you get the hang of things.

When creating your issue always go through this checklist so your issue is findable and usable:

- **Name**: Name your issue something helpful including: your name, the name of the module, and which week it is for
- **Assign**: Assign the issue to yourself.
- **Label**: Label your issue with `week-n`, _and_ `homework`.
  - If your home repository has more than one class (ie. Class 9 & Class 10), please label your issue with your class number: `class-n`
- **Milestone**: Set the current module as a milestone.
- **Project**: Add your issue to this module's homework board.

Besides making it easier to filter and search all of the issues in your class repository, following these steps helps us to easily understand your individual progress through the course (using the GitHub API). Help us help you!

Once your issue is set-up write the **Check-Boxs** for this week's assignments including the prep work, project, and exercises.

## Submission and Feedback Process

We use GitHub [Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues), [Project Boards](https://codeburst.io/an-introduction-to-github-project-boards-2944e6ffbf3c) and [Notifications](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications) to submit assignments and give feedback. You will find a [template issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) you can use to start each week's submission.

This homework submission workflow is very similar to a professional collaboration workflow. You will be able to use GitHub's powerful code review tools to receive & implement feedback, and everything will be centralized in on place: your class repository on GitHub!

The weekly workflow for submission and feedback will look something like this:

1. The week before class:
   1. Create a new issue in your class repo for the coming week (the `weekly-homework` template is helpful)
   1. Study the prep work for the next Sunday
   1. **PREP WORK**: Add your issue to the "PREP WORK" column of the current module's project board _after_ you have familiarized yourself with all of the preparation topics.
1. Attend class on Sunday (on time at 12h!). In class you will prepare for the weekly homework assignments
1. Study away! Move your card to the "IN PROGRESS" column once you have begun working on the week's project.
1. You will keep your coaches and classmates up to date on your progress and your challenges by checking off the boxes in your issue and by moving your card on the project board.
   - **BLOCKED**: If you are very stuck or confused, move your card to the "BLOCKED" column and leave a comment in your issue describing what has you blocked. Include screen shots and [link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet)! A coach, alumni, or classmate will be around soon to help you figure it out. When you are no longer blocked, please move your card back to ...
   - **IN PROGRESS**: Keep your card here when you are happily working away. Using the check-boxes in your issue you can keep track of how many assignments you have finished so far.
   - **READY FOR REVIEW**: When you think your homework is finished (the project is complete and you've started all of the exercises). Then move your card into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column _and_ label it `ready-for-review`.
1. A coach or alumni will look over your work
   - **NEEDS REVISION**: If there is anything to improve they will leave their feedback for you directly on GitHub, either in your weekly issue or as new issues in your repository. You will also know which exercises need revision by which check-boxes are empty. After you have addressed all of the feedback, please move your card back into the "READY FOR REVIEW" column so we know to take another look.
   - **Week X: DONE**: When all of your assignments are checked off and you've addressed all feedback, "DONE"! There will be a separate column for each week's completed homework assignments. _(Only coaches can move cards into the "DONE" column!)_

## Missing Assignments Policy

1. Missing _3_ homework submissions is grounds for leaving Hack Your Future. Should this happen we will have a 1-1 meeting with you to determine the best course of action. (not turning on GitHub Pages counts as a missed submission!)
1. Submitting _2_ incomplete homework assignments is a sign that you need more support or accommodation from us. Should this happen please get in touch with us to schedule a 1-1 meeting with so we can understand your situation and how we can best help you.
1. Cheating _1_ time is grounds for leaving Hack Your Future. if we find out you are doing this we will have a 1-1 meeting and it will probably be the end of your time with us.

What does this all mean? It means:

- Submit your homework even if it isn’t complete. We can’t help you if we don’t know what you’re struggling with! If you are not able to finish your project on time, please leave your card in the "BLOCKED" column. Not finishing an assignment because you were truely stuck will never get you in trouble, but saying you are finished when you clearly aren't will count as a missed assignment. This is how we will know to help you.
- Be accountable and thorough, ask for help often and submit your homework on time. If you haven't completed the whole assignment you can still submit it correctly.
- There is no penalty for not understanding, only for not trying. Web development is very challenging, even your coaches spend most of their time learning and fixing mistakes!
- Cheating is not tolerated. There is a large difference between stealing and collaborating, even if the end result looks the same (ie. you both have the same code).
  - **Collaboration** is when you ask each other for help or for explanations, you voluntarily share snippets of code, and take the time to explain/understand what has been shared.
  - **Cheating** is when you copy someone’s code to complete the homeworks without taking to the time to understand it, and without them explaining why they wrote what they did.
- If we see two or more homework assignments with the same solutions we will check in with everyone involved to see if this was collaborative work or cheating.
