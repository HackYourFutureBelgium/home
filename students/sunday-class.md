# Sunday Class

It's helpful to think about each Sunday Class as **a workshop instead of a lecture hall**.

You are expected to **study the assigned prep work _before_ arriving** - this will cover the theory you need to dive into the exercises on Sunday. Most of your time each Sunday will be spent working in small groups on a set of exercises and a small project. Coaches are there in the first place to support your groups, not to teach the material.

_You will not cover the whole week's material on Sunday._ In Sunday Classes you will cover just enough new material to finish a small project in class.  This new material and mini-project will help you to get started with the week's assignments but (repeat) _are not everything you need to learn_.  **HYF is a majority self-study course.** It's not your coaches' responsibility to make sure you learn everything!

So come prepared each Sunday to spend some time together and practice collaborating in small groups.  After all, these are the hardest things to study alone over the week :)

> During the  Covid-19 confinement, Sunday classes will be held online. We will share the _All Together_ and _Small Group_ video links on Slack (see channel topics).

Here's the schedule for a standard Sunday:

## All Together - Review & Today's Project

### Roll Call

Each student leave a comment in the class' `roll-call` issue:

* Summarize your week using emojis.
* Something you'd like to share, anything goes! (within respect)

### Review

Your coaches will spend some time leading a review session of last week's assignments and this week's prep work.

The best way for you to help your coaches give a helpful review session is to **create [Sunday Review Issues](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/asking-for-help)** in your class repo.  This way they can prepare clear examples and presentations ahead of time.

But also ask new questions in person on Sunday! This is the time to clear up any questions you forgot to ask with an Issue in your class repo, or on Slack.

### Today's Objectives

Your coaches will give a short introduction to this Sunday's exercises and project. They will help you understand _why_ the new material is important and _how_ you will use it in the class project. Because you are expected to have studied the prep work and theory before Sunday, the coaches will spend this time stepping through some practical examples instead of explaining the basics.

## Small Groups - Isolate

Break into your small groups and get started on this Sundays' exercises!

### Stand Up

Do a quick stand-up meeting, this is your chance to share what went well and what was difficult last week.  But keep it short! You shouldn't take longer than ~30 seconds per person. This is a chance to practice being clear and precise about you are learning.



### The Exercises

Each module repository has a directory called `/isolate`.  In there you will find all of the exercises and example snippets for the module.  The **Sunday Lesson Plan & README** will list the exercises/examples to focus on that Sunday.

Some tips for studying code:

* Don't rush, understand!  Programming is hard.
  * The examples and exercises will still be there to study for the rest of the week.
  * It's better to fail slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass quickly and not understand why.
* Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
* Don't skip the examples!  Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very efficient way to learn programming.
* Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips.

## All Together: Check-In

A check-in from each group, keep it short and to the point!

* A report on your group's stand-up
* What went well with the exercises?
* What was challenging in the exercises?

## Break

Peace and crackers!

## All Together - Project Prep

Your coaches will review the exercises that caused you all the most trouble and introduce the Sunday project. this might include:

* Explaining how what you learned in the exercises fits with what you've learned before
* Explaining when they've used these skills in their real lives
* A demo of how your finished project should behave
* Stepping through the project starter code
* Sharing some debugging tips that will come in handy

## Small Groups - Integrate

Break into your small groups and begin working on the day's project (after studying the examples ;))!
Each module repository has a directory called `/integrate`.  In there you will find a collection of finished projects to study.  **The Sunday Lesson Plan & README** will list the example projects that are most helpful for this Sunday.

The project itself will be hosted as a separate repository so you can practice pushing, pulling, branching and collaboration.  You will find a link to the starter repo in the Lesson Plan and weekly README.

Some tips for working on the projects:

* Pair programming!
* Take turns explaining how the example projects work:
  * Which files and folders are there? What role does each one play in the program?
  * What language features are used in the program?
  * How is today's new material integrated into the project?
* Practice workflows and project planning. There's plenty of time to write code over the week, spend your time together practicing collaboration:
  * Write or study the Development Strategy together before starting to code
  * Try forking your group's repository and sending a pull request with one of the user stories completed
  * Open a project board and practice using issues to manage your project

## All Together - Check-In & Homework Launch

### Check-In: Project

A ~1 minute check-in from each group on what you've learned and struggled with in the class project.

### Homework Launch

Your coaches will give a quick introduction to the week's assignments.

Now's your last chance to ask any questions you have in person!
