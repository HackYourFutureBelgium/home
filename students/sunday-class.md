# Sunday Class

It's helpful to think about each Sunday Class as **a workshop instead of a lecture hall**.

You are expected to **study the assigned prep work _before_ arriving** - this will cover the theory you need to dive into the exercises on Sunday. Most of your time each Sunday will be spent working in small groups on a set of exercises and a small project. Coaches are there in the first place to support your groups, not to teach the material.

_You will not cover the whole week's material on Sunday._ In Sunday Classes you will cover just enough new material to finish a small project in class.  This new material and mini-project will help you to get started with the week's assignments but (repeat) _are not everything you need to learn_.  **HYF is a majority self-study course.** It's not your coaches' responsibility to make sure you learn everything!

So come prepared each Sunday to spend some time together and practice collaborating in small groups.  After all, these are the hardest things to study alone over the week :)

> During the  Covid-19 confinement, Sunday classes will be held online. We will share the _All Together_ and _Small Group_ video links on Slack (see channel topics).

Here's the schedule for a standard Sunday:

## All Together - Review & New Material


### Check-In

Each student takes ~30 seconds to share their progress over the last week:

* What went well?
* What was challenging?
* What will you try differently this week?

Don't hesitate to speak up! This is a time for you all to discuss what you studied the last week.
This is a co-learning moment for each one of you.

### Review

Your coaches will spend some time leading a review session of last week's assignments.

The best way for you to help your coaches give a helpful review session is to **create [Sunday Review Issues](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home/blob/master/students/asking-for-help.md)** in your class repo.  This way they can prepare clear examples and presentations ahead of time.

But also ask new questions in person on Sunday! This is the time to clear up any questions you forgot to ask with an Issue in your class repo, or on Slack.

### New Material

Your coaches will give a short introduction to this Sunday's new material. Because you are expected to have studied the prep work and theory before Sunday, the coaches will spend this time stepping through some practical examples and helping you understand _why_ the new material is important to learn.

## Small Groups - Isolate

Break into your small groups and get started on this Sundays' exercises!

Each module repository has a directory called `/isolate`.  In there you will find all of the exercises and example snippets for the module.  The **Sunday Lesson Plan & README** will list the exercises/examples to focus on that Sunday.

Some tips for studying code:

* Don't rush, understand!  Programming is hard.
  * The examples and exercises will still be there to study for the rest of the week.
  * It's better to fail slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass quickly and not understand why.
* Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
* Don't skip the examples!  Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very efficient way to learn programming.
* Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips.

## Break

Peace and crackers!

## All Together - Recap & Project Demo

### Check-In

A ~1 minute check-in from each group on what you've learned and struggled with in the exercises.

### Recap

Your coaches will step through the exercises & topics that caused the most trouble.

### Project Demo

Your coaches will introduce the Sunday project, this might include:

* Explaining how what you learned in the exercises fits with what you've already learned
* Explaining how to integrate your new knowledge into a realistic project
* A demo of how your finished project should behave
* Explaining how to structure your source code
* Some debugging tips that will come in handy
* A suggested development strategy

## Small Groups - Integrate

Break into your small groups and begin working on the day's project (after studying the examples ;))!
Each module repository has a directory called `/integrate`.  In there you will find a collection of finished projects to study.  **The Sunday Lesson Plan & README** will list the example projects that are most helpful for this Sunday.

The project itself will be hosted as a separate repository so you can practice pushing, pulling, branching and collaboration.  You will find a link to the starter repo in the Lesson Plan and weekly README.

Some tips for working on the projects:

* Pair programming!
* Take turns explaining how the example projects work:
  * Which files and folders are there? What role does each one play in the program?
  * What language features are used in the program?
  * How is today's new material integrated into the project?
* Practice workflows and project planning. There's plenty of time to write code over the week, spend your time together practicing collaboration:
  * Write or study the Development Strategy together before starting to code
  * Try forking your group's repository and sending a pull request with one of the user stories completed
  * Open a project board and practice using issues to manage your project

## All Together - Recap & Homework Intro

### Check-In

A ~1 minute check-in from each group on what you've learned and struggled with in the exercises.

### Homework Intro

Your coaches will give a quick introduction to the week's assignments.

Now's your last chance to ask any questions you have in person!
