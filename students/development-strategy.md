# Development Strategies

There is much more to coding than code!

At HackYourFuture Belgium, we think it's most important that you learn to plan what you write, to organize your code, and to structure your development process.  To help you master these skills you will learn to read and write `development-strategy.md` files. While these files are not used professionally, they will help you to build the understanding you need to collaborate like a pro.

So what are these files like?

- [Main Idea](#main-idea)
- [Strategy Outline](#strategy-outline)
  1. [Title and Description](title-and-description)
  1. [Wireframes](#wireframes)
  1. [Planned Steps](#planned-steps)
- [Examples](#examples)

## Main Idea

The main idea behind a `development-strategy` is that you learn how to break your projects into small steps, and to think about each step in 3 different ways:

1. __As a experience__
    - What new functionality are you adding at each step?
    - How does step change the end user's experience?
1. __As source code__
    - How have your organized the files of code in your project?
    - What changes do you make in each file at each step?
1. __As a collaborative project__
    - How have you shared the tasks?
    - How will you keep each other up to date on your progress?

> Note: Not all of your projects will be collaborative, for solo projects you can ignore #3.

## Strategy Outline

Your development strategy files will all have the same basic layout, even if the details will change based on the project you are building.

### Title and Description

Give the title of your project and a brief description of it.  At this point you are _not_ describing what the project will look like or how you will code it.  You want to focus on who it's for and how they would benefit from using it:

- who is the end user?
- what does it do for them?
- why would they want to do this?

### Wireframes

How will your user interface be laid out? Include basic sketches of what the different pages on your site will be like.  Your wireframes should be the minimum possible to explain how your site will look: no color, no images, no real words, ... just boxes and small comments!

A good first tool for creating wireframes is [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/).  It's just what you need and nothing more.

### Planned Steps

This is the big one!  How have you broken this full projects into little steps?  And what tasks need to be completed for this step?

Each planned step might include:

1. The number and name of the step
1. The user story for this step
1. Acceptance criteria for this user story
1. Which files of code need to be changed, and what changes need to be made
1. Which branches will be used, and where they will be merged
1. Who is assigned each task (if you are collaborating)

## Examples

You will use development strategies for the first time in week 1 of the Incremental Development module.  Take a look at these first development strategies to get the main idea:
