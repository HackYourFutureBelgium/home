# Weekly Assignments

A quick guide to homework at HYF.

## Types of Assignments

While studying with us you will come across 5 different types of assignments. They all serve different purposes, but all will help you succeed at HYF and beyond.

### Prep Work

> You are expected to be familiar with each topic when class starts on Sunday

At the top of each week's README.md you will find a list of videos, articles or examples to study **before** coming into class on Sunday. These resources will be _organized by topic_. You do not need to deeply study each and every link, but we do expect you to familiarize yourself with each topic. This might mean studying one link from each topic in detail and only skimming the rest. It's up to you to find the method that works best for you.

### Lesson Plan

> You are required to start all _Lesson Plan_ activities

Each Sunday you will have a set of exercises and a small project to study in groups.  These will introduce key skills & concepts you'll need in the coming week.  If your group does not finish them in class on Sunday, no problem!  You can keep studying them over the week

### Suggested Study

> 100% Optional

Each week's assignments will include a list of study links that you might find helpful for the week's homework.  If you don't find them helpful, no worries.

If you find a great resource that you think would help other students, please share it with a pull request!

### Exercises

> Follow the emoji hints for each exercise

Not all exercises are created equal. These 3 emoji's will help you figure out how to spend your study time as effectively as possible.

- :egg: `:egg:` - these exercises are required, they cover the base skills you'll need to move on.
- :hatching_chick: `:hatching_chick:` - do your best to start these exercises. you don't need to finish or master them (yet) but getting the main idea will be helpful in coming weeks
- :hatched_chick: `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the :egg:'s and :hatching_chick:'s? push yourself with these challenges!

Alongside each week's project there will be a set of exercises. Unlike projects the exercises will focus in on specific skills, tools or concepts. Exercises are made up of smaller and more repetitive problems to solve, always with tests so you can move through them with confidence.

Sometimes there will be _a lot_ of exercises, and these exercises can be quite challenging. You should start each set of exercises to be aware of the skills you're expected to apply in the projects, but you are not expected to complete every exercise the week they are assigned. If you find you want to dive deeper into one topic, or that you've finished the project early and want to keep studying, go on and finish all the exercises! Otherwise they'll always be there for you, you can go back and complete the exercises later in the course or after you leave HYF. This has been a successful strategy for many students before you.


Exercises will come in 3 general types as well:

1. **Theory**: Theory exercises will look deeply at the technologies you are using. All of these exercises will be accompanied by an execution visualization for you to really understand what's happening behind your code. You might find these exercises a bit dry, or might love them! Either way they're worth every minute you spend studying them. If you don't take the time to master the theory exercises you will have a hard time debugging your code, applying the technologies correctly, writing & reading tests, or effectively using the developer tools.
1. **Practice**: These exercises are what you probably think of as standard coding exercises, the types of challenges you find on FreeCodeCamp and other web tutorials. Practice exercises will be bite-sized coding challenges that ask you apply the technologies you studied in Theory exercises to solve small challenges.
1. **Integration**: Integration exercises are effectively tiny projects. In them you will practice integrating the various skills and technologies you've learned so far into realistic (but tiny) projects. Imagine something like building 5 websites with only one button each. It's enough to practice the process of building and completing something without getting lost in the size of your project.


### Projects

> You are required to make it as far as possible in the projects

You will be assigned one project each week. The goal of projects is to get "the big picture". Learning how to approach a large challenge, break it down to smaller pieces, and apply the skills you're learning to build incremental solutions. These projects are about more than just writing code that works! You'll be expected to ...

- Break your project into steps and to develop those steps on separate branches, merging them into `master` when the step is complete.
- A README describing your project in detail. Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3).
- Inclide a markdown file called `development-strategy.md` describing the steps you made to complete your project, what value each step adds to the use, and what code you wrote to build each step.
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages at first, and non-static hosting solutions once you start building full web apps.

Projects come in three types:

1. **Code-Alongs**: For code-along projects you will be assigned a video tutorial to study. You'll need to submit your version of the tutorial's project in a new repository developed with branches, and with a complete README. Code-along projects are very good for learning new technologies and skills
1. **Starter-Code**: For starter-code projects you'll be given a repository containing a partially complete project and instructions about the steps necessary to complete it. You'll need to submit your complete project in a new repository, developed with branches, and with a complete README. Many of these projects will come with built-in tests to guide you on your way. Starter-code projects will help you learn how to read and understand source code, debug existing projects, and work withing pre-existing constraints.
1. **Open-Ended**: Open-ended projects are what they sound like. We'll give you a mock-up of a website or a list of user stories and the rest is up to you! The code-alongs and starter-code projects are designed to guide you to good ways of structuring you code and solving common problems, open-ended projects are your chance to practice these skills "in the wild"!
