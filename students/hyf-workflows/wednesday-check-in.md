# Wednesday Check-In

You will be required to post a check-in comment each Wednesday in your module `check-in` issue.

These check-ins are how you will keep track of your progress on your individual study. Coaches, peers and HYF team will read your check-in to know how we can help supporting you. Coaches will also use your Wednesday Check-Ins to prepare for the evening review call. Please include:

- _Check Boxes_: started the exercises, link to project issue (if there is a project that week)
- **I Need Help with**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of the homework are you struggling to complete?
- **What went well?**: What has been successful so far? have you learned and/or completed so far this week?
- **What went less well?**: What mistakes did you and/or your group make? What was difficult?
- **Lessons Learned**: What did you learn this week that you will take with you into next week? I can be technical, a mindset, a study habit, anything!
- **Sunday Prep Work**: Begin organizing your prep work for the following Sunday.

When you have posted your Wednesday Check-in comment please add the `week-x` label to your issue, so we know it's ready for review.

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it `checked-x`.

> If you are blocked on something then a coach or classmate will get in touch to help you
