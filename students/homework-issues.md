# Homework Issues

For each week you will create a new _homework issue_ using the __Weekly homework issue__ template in your class repository. You, your coach and your classmates will use will use it to track your progress, help you when you're stuck, and give feedback when you've finished. Your class repository has a template issue you can use to help you get the hang of things.

After filling in the blanks on your issue according to this week's assignments, go through this checklist to make your issue findable. Following these steps will make it easy to filter and find any issue in the class repo:

- **Name**: Name your issue something helpful including: your name, the name of the module, and which week it is for
- **Assign**: Assign the issue to yourself.
- **Label**: Label your issue with `week-n`, _and_ `homework`.
  - If your home repository has more than one class (ie. Class 9 & Class 10), please label your issue with your class number: `class-n`
- **Milestone**: Set the current module as a milestone.
- **Project**: Add your issue to this module's homework board. (don't forget to drag it into a column!)

Once your issue is set-up write the **Check-Boxs** for this week's assignments including the prep work, project, and exercises.
