# Asking for Help

Programming is hard, HYF goes by very fast, and your classmates are all asking the same questions as you. So help each other out!

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 20 min_: Try on your own
1. _20 -> 60 min_: Ask your classmates for help
   - Move your issue to `BLOCKED` on the project board and ask for help on the shared channel
   - No private messages please! you will never be the only person with this question
1. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in your issue

## On GitHub

Software developers have found many great ways to collaborate on shared code bases. These workflows are different from what you've probably used before, but are super helpful once you get the hang of it. We encourage you to ask and answer as many code-related questions as possible directly on GitHub so you can get used to the code-review process _before_ reaching the final project. The three main ways for you to discuss code on GitHub will be:

### Project Board: `BLOCKED`

If you are very stuck or confused on an assignment, move your card to the `BLOCKED` column and leave a comment in your issue describing what has you blocked. Include screen shots of your debugger, [link(s) to specific line(s) of code](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet), and a list of things you've already tried. A coach, alumni, or classmate will be around soon to help you figure it out.

When you're no longer stuck, give a shout-out to whoever helped you and move your issue out of the `BLOCKED` column.

### Label: `sunday-review`

Your class repository has [a label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/labeling-issues-and-pull-requests) called `sunday-review` (it's bright yellow 🌞). Whenever you come across a problem or topic that you would like to review in person on Sunday go ahead and label it `sunday-review`!

What's most important is that you are clear about what you're confused by, what you've tried so far, and that you provide extra links for context (ie. links to your code, to helpful resources, ...).

During the review section of class your coaches will go through all of the `sunday-review` issues, closing them when your question has been answered.

### Pull Request: Code Review

Issues and Labels are great for discussions, but sometimes you need to get right into the code! The best way to share a suggestion or fix to one of your classmate's assignments is using [a pull request & code review](https://github.com/features/code-review/) directly on their repository.

You will be able to share updates to particular lines of code, explain why you are suggesting this change, discuss the new code, and integrate the changes into the existing code base.

## On Slack

GitHub is great for deeper discussions around the weekly assignments, but not everything in life is work! Hop on over to Slack if you have questions about what you should be working on, would just like a quick tip, or are just looking to chat about how much you love coding :)

Please use your main class channel as much as possible, and reply in threads to keep the main discussion feed easier to follow.
